## üîç Best Practices Reminders

1. **Maintain Visual Consistency**:
   - Always reference the UI_DESIGN_BREAKDOWN.md for exact dimensions
   - Match the color schemes precisely using our global CSS variables
   - Follow the specified typography system consistently

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Use CSS transitions instead of JavaScript animations when possible
   - Purge unused styles in production
   - Lazy load components and images
   - Use proper will-change properties for animations

3. **Accessibility Excellence**:
   - Ensure all interactive elements have proper ARIA attributes
   - Maintain contrast ratios meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standards
   - Support keyboard navigation throughout
   - Provide text alternatives for non-text content
   - Respect user preferences for motion and contrast

4. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**:
   - Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Use feature detection over browser detection
   - Include appropriate polyfills for older browsers
   - Test on both iOS and Android devices

5. **State Management**:
   - Use the theme context for global styling state
   - Handle loading, error, and success states gracefully
   - Provide visual feedback for all user interactions
   - Persist user preferences using localStorage

Following these updated prompts will ensure that all components integrate seamlessly with our global CSS system while maintaining design consistency across the entire application.
