You are generating engaging and emotionally resonant multiple-choice questions for an interactive quiz web application targeted at Indian Gen-Z users (age 18–28). These quizzes aim to explore a person’s emotional depth, relationship boundaries, and personality traits.

Your tone should feel like a close friend asking something deep but casually — the style must be 40% Hindi + 60% English (Hinglish). Avoid overly formal or robotic tones.

✅ Generate **6 questions for each of the 4 categories** below.  
✅ Each question should be scenario-based, short (1–2 lines), and feel emotionally relatable.  
✅ Add 4 answer options per question, each with a score (1 to 5) and **1–2 emotional tags** like: `"ghosted"`, `"emotional wall"`, `"clarity"`, `"fake bonding"` etc.

---

### 🔹 **Category 1: Heart Reality**
Focus on romantic pain, heartbreak, trust issues, and fake love. Make the questions feel like heartbreak conversations — like when someone starts acting distant or gives mixed signals.  
**Example line:**  
"Kabhi laga kisi ne sirf boredom mein tumse pyaar jataaya ho?"

---

### 🔹 **Category 2: Bond Insight**
Explore friendship boundaries, fading bonds, fake friends, and loyalty. These should reflect how some friendships fade silently or become toxic.  
**Example line:**  
"Un dino mein jab sab khush the, kya kisi friend ne tumhe purposely ignore kiya tha?"

---

### 🔹 **Category 3: Emotional Armor**
Dive into insecurities, emotional walls, overthinking, and fear of expressing feelings. These should touch inner struggles people usually hide.  
**Example line:**  
"Jab kisi ne ‘I’m fine’ bola, tumne bhi waise hi fake smile kar di — sirf connect banaye rakhne ke liye?"

---

### 🔹 **Category 4: One-Sided Lens**
Focus on one-sided love, effort imbalance, and lack of emotional reciprocation. These are those draining situations where one person gives too much.  
**Example line:**  
"Jab tumne 100 baar text kiya, aur unka ek ‘hmm’ mila, tab kya feel hua?"

---

**Instructions for Each Question:**
- Keep the tone raw, relatable and slightly emotional.
- Don’t make the questions too long or too poetic.
- Use emojis *only if* they add to the tone — don’t overuse.
- Each option should sound like a *real person’s thought* in that situation.
- Make sure all options reflect slightly different emotional reactions.
You are working on a React-based interactive quiz app. The app has 4 categories: Heart Reality, Bond Insight, Emotional Armor, and One-Sided Lens. Each category needs 6 new questions. Each question has:
- 1 short, Hinglish scenario-based question
- 4 multiple choice answers (1–2 lines each)
- Each answer must include:
   - A `score` (1–5)
   - Emotional `tags` like "ghosted", "emotional wall", "clarity", etc.

🛠️ Your task:
1. **Generate** 6 questions for each category (total 24).
2. **Update the existing JSON file or question data file** with the new question bank.
3. Make sure to keep the current structure used in the app (example object below).
4. Update any related files used for:
   - **Scoring logic**
   - **Result interpretation**
   - **Answer evaluation logic**
   - **State handling** (Redux/Zustand/context if applicable)
5. Replace any old placeholder questions with this new data.
