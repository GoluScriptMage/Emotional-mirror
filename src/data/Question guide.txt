You're building a personalized, emotion-based quiz app in React with four major categories:

1. ❤️ Heart Reality — Romance, detachment, heartbreak, trust.
2. 🔗 Bond Insight — Friendships, fading bonds, loyalty gaps.
3. 🛡️ Emotional Armor — Emotional shutdown, defense mode, faking strength.
4. 👁️ One-Sided Lens — Imbalance in effort, attention, and silent sacrifices.

🚀 TASK:
Generate **6 total questions per category** (24 total), using the **following format** strictly:

{
  "id": "heart_reality_1",
  "question": "Someone texts 'I miss you 😔' but {name} just stares at the screen, feeling hollow inside...",
  "englishHint": "What do you think when someone misses you but you feel nothing?",
  "hinglishHint": "Koi kehta hai 'miss you' par andar kuch feel hi nahi hota... Tere dil mein woh khaali-pan kyun hai? 💔😶",
  "options": [
    { "id": "a", "text": "\"I should fake a sweet reply, right?\" 🎭", "points": 1 },
    { "id": "b", "text": "\"Do I even remember how to miss someone?\" 🤔", "points": 2 },
    { "id": "c", "text": "\"Cute... but I need my space, yaar.\" 🧊", "points": 3 },
    { "id": "d", "text": "\"Want to reply but fingers feel heavy AF.\" 📱", "points": 2 }
  ],
  "scoreTag": "Emotional Walls"
}

📝 INSTRUCTIONS:
- Each question must include:
  - `question`: A scene-style description (use mild emotion + emoji)
  - `englishHint`: Logical, relatable follow-up in English
  - `hinglishHint`: Friendly, emotional version with Hindi-English tone
  - `options`: 4 short, unique answer choices with different thinking styles + 1–5 point scale
  - `scoreTag`: One-word emotional theme tag (e.g., "Attachment", "Lonely Effort", "Guarded", etc.)

✨ TONE + STYLE:
- Use **60% English + 40% Hinglish** mix
- Keep it slightly emotional but **not too heavy**
- Add 1–2 **meaningful emojis** per question or option
- Ensure language feels natural and relatable to 18–25 age group
- Imagine two friends chatting seriously but casually

🛠️ ALSO:
- Automatically update the **JSON file** where questions are stored
- Update **score logic** and result-display logic if tags/scores change
- Maintain **scalable data model** (don’t hardcode anything)
- Validate question IDs and tag variety across categories

🎯 GOAL:
Make questions feel **real, expressive, and slightly introspective** — users should feel seen, not overwhelmed.
