You are creating questions for a React-based personality quiz web app.

üîÆ Objective:
Generate **6 interactive, emotionally engaging multiple-choice questions** under a specific category (like friendship, heartbreak, personality, etc.) for a web-based calculator app. These questions should sound relatable, modern, and have Hinglish/English mix (spoken tone).

üéØ Question Style:
- Use Gen-Z / 20s vibe, simple Hinglish, playful or emotional tone.
- Use relatable modern situations (ghosting, ignored chats, fun banter, secret feelings, social awkwardness, etc.)
- Keep it friendly and reflective.

üß© Structure per question:
1. Question text (Hinglish + light English, natural style)
2. Four multiple-choice answers.
3. Each answer must have:
   - `text`: the option's wording
   - `score`: a numeric value (1 to 4)
   - `tag`: based on personality or emotional type (example tags: "Emotional Walls", "Lost Bond", "One-Sided", "Friendship Boundary")

üí° Tags:
Use any 3‚Äì4 tags across the 6 questions from this list:
- Emotional Walls
- One-sided Connection
- Lost Bond
- Friendship Boundary
- Hopeful Crush
- Curious Observer
- Funny Vibes

‚ö†Ô∏è Important:
- Avoid over-complicated English. Stick to fun and emotional Hinglish.
- Keep the answer scores and tag logic balanced.
- Make sure each question is relatable to today's youth.
- Do NOT add explanations. Only give clean structured data (JSON or array format) for each question.
